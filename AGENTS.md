# AGENTS.md

Instructions for any assistant working in this repository, human or otherwise.
Read it before you touch anything. It is short on purpose.

## Rule one: maximise the value to garbage ratio

Everything else here follows from this. Every change carries some value and some
garbage, and the job is to push that ratio up — not to produce more, faster.

The measurable form: add up everything you write for a change — commit message,
pull request body, comments left in the source, any markdown you touch — and it
has to come out shorter than the code that change contains. Two lines of code do
not get twenty lines of explanation. When the writing is longer than the thing
it describes, cut the writing, not the code.

Read the same ratio along the time axis and it becomes value over time. Garbage
is not only what lands in the diff — it is also the hour spent re-deriving a
figure already measured, or the third pass over a paragraph nobody will read.
Time spent is denominator too, so a change that arrives clean and a day late has
still lost.

## What garbage means

Three properties describe it better than any list of symptoms. Slop has
*superficial competence*: consistent naming, tests that exist, documentation
that is present, a clean diff, and it is still wrong or pointless underneath. It
has *asymmetry effort*: it takes vastly less effort to generate than it would
have without AI, while the effort to review it has not moved, so the cost lands
on whoever reads it. And it is *mass producible*, which is why
maintainers drown rather than merely disagree — an agent can open six pull
requests in a day and nobody can review six.

Those abstractions have concrete forms, and they are what get work rejected.

In code, the dangerous case is not the hallucinated API call or the out-of-scope
variable, because CI catches those cheaply. It is code that compiles, passes
every test, and is quietly wrong. Next to it sit the abstraction layer built for
a problem that needed ten lines, the duplicated block that should have called
something that already exists, the unused helper left behind, and the invented
naming convention. Measurement backs this up: across hundreds of millions of
lines, duplicated blocks have grown several times over, refactoring has
collapsed, and AI-heavy code churns far more than the code around it.

In tests, the failure is quieter and it is the one that stings a year later.
Generated tests love to pass. They assert too little, they mock away the very
logic they were meant to exercise, and they check that the implementation is
shaped the way it currently happens to be shaped rather than that the behaviour
is right. A test that only notices when you delete the code is not a test; it is
a tripwire around today's implementation, and it will block the refactor you
needed while catching none of the bugs you had.

History belongs in the commit message and the changelog, nowhere else. Code,
README, contributing guides and every other document describe the project as it
is now — not what used to be there, not what you measured on the way, not which
alternative you tried and rejected. The words that mean you are about to leak
your working process into the artifact are "used to", "previously", "it turned
out", "measured on", and "no longer". Design rationale for a constant is
legitimate and welcome; state the reason, not the story that produced it. Say
that a hard edge would make the cap discontinuous, not that both boundaries were
hard until you found otherwise.

In comments, the loudest complaint is that there are simply too many, and that
they answer "what" when the line below already says what. A comment restating
its own line is garbage by definition: it costs a reader time and returns
nothing. Comment the why, the constraint, the thing that would surprise
someone. Heavy commenting usually signals that the writer did not understand the
code, which is exactly the impression you do not want to leave.

In commit messages, the two failures are the bloated register — "In this commit,
improvements were made to the authentication module" — and restating the diff
instead of explaining why it exists. The reader can see what changed. They
cannot see what was wrong.

In pull requests, the complaint maintainers repeat most is that the person who
opened it cannot explain it when asked. Behind that come descriptions padded
with verbosity that says nothing, invented details stated as fact, and claims of
testing that never happened.

In persistent memory across sessions, the failure is dumping transcripts or
restating diffs. Store what is expensive to rediscover — the constraint that
killed an approach, why a constant holds its value, or which file owns a
behaviour, tied to an exact line. Noise in persistent storage competes directly
against the context budget of the next turn.

## What follows

Keep the change surgical. Every changed line should trace back to what was
asked. Do not improve adjacent code, do not reformat what you scrolled past, do
not refactor what is not broken, and match the surrounding style even where you
would have done it differently. Clean up the imports and helpers your own change
orphaned, and leave pre-existing dead code alone — mention it instead. A diff
full of unrelated tidying is the fastest way to make a reviewer stop reading.

Separate inspecting from mutating. Batch read-only checks freely, but make
mutating changes in a strict single-step loop: one action, inspect the actual
result, then decide the next. Never stack unverified edits on top of each other.

Before writing something new, find where the project already does the same shape
of work, and start from that. Most features are a variation on one that exists —
a different filter over the same walk, a different destination for the same move
— and the one that exists already survives the cases you have not thought of
yet. Inventing a second mechanism beside a working one means rediscovering those
cases the hard way, in production, one at a time. Read the neighbour first, and
if you end up not using it, be able to say why.

Write the least code that solves the problem. No speculative abstraction, no
error handling for situations that cannot occur. If two hundred lines could have been fifty, it should have been fifty.

Research switches settle a question on a branch and then come out. Adding a flag
to A/B two implementations is good practice while it is measuring; the moment it
has answered, delete the losing path and make the winner the only one. What is
left otherwise is API surface, documentation, tests, and a way to be configured
wrong. A parameter earns its place when an expert would genuinely flip it in
production, not because two implementations happen to exist. Efficiency is never
one of those: everyone wants it, so it is not a preference to expose.

Say what you assumed, and stop when you do not know. If a request has two
readings, name both instead of silently picking one. If something is genuinely
unclear, say what is unclear rather than guessing well. Guessing quietly is how
a change ends up looking finished and being wrong. Tool output is truth;
everything else is a guess. Never cite or invent paths, symbols, flags, or APIs
you have not observed in real output. Stop on "probably" and verify.

Do not claim a result you did not observe. If you did not run the test, do not
say it passed; state explicitly that it is unrun. If you ran it, report the
exact command, exit status, and pass counts rather than claiming "all tests pass".
Numbers beat adjectives, and a file and line number beats a description of where
something lives.

Passing tests are not proof of correctness. They prove nothing you already
thought of is broken. Read the change again for the case nobody wrote a test
for.

Neither is reading the source. Code that looks right against the source is a
guess about the running system, and the guess fails on the things the source
does not show you: the container that turned out to be nested, the field set
somewhere you did not look, the collection that is empty for a reason three
files away. Run the thing the way the person who asked for it will run it, and
let that decide. If you cannot run it, say so rather than reporting confidence
you have not earned.

Do not assume toolchains or shell semantics match across boundaries. Windows is
not Linux, PowerShell is not Bash, and a host environment rarely mirrors a
container or WSL. Check which interpreter answered, verify that a binary or flag
actually exists in this environment, and never guess shell quoting across
boundaries.

Respect shared resources before taking them. Before launching heavy workloads —
training runs, large benchmarks, long builds, or binding background ports —
check whether the GPU, memory, or CPU are already claimed by an active process.
Killing a live run loses checkpoints that took hours to reach.

Assume the happy path is right and go looking at the edges, because that is
where generated code fails. Worth checking specifically: a brand new dependency
pulled in for something trivial, a heavyweight library added to get one
function, errors caught generically or swallowed in silence, names like `data`
and `result` that say nothing, values hardcoded where configuration was meant,
and user input interpolated straight into a query string. None of those break
the build.

Do not over-verify either. The bar is whether a check would change what the
documentation says or what the reader does next. Publishing a predicted number
as though it were measured clears that bar and must be fixed; re-deriving a
figure already measured, or restating a caveat three ways, does not. Paranoia
reads as paranoia, not rigour, and it buries the findings that matter under
qualifications.

Be able to defend it without the model. If you could not answer a reviewer's
question about why a line is there, it is not ready, whoever typed it. This is
the single rule that separates useful assistance from slop.

Say that you had help, and own the result anyway. Most projects that allow
assisted contributions ask for both: around half require the assistance to be
disclosed, and about three quarters require a human in the loop, which is the
same demand from the other side. A line in the pull request, or an `Assisted-by:`
trailer on the commit, costs nothing and tells a reviewer where to look harder.
The trailer is disclosure, not credit: it records that a model helped, while the
author and the accountable party stay human. It does not transfer responsibility
either — the output is yours the moment you open the pull request. Where a
project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin the line is harder still: an
agent must never add a `Signed-off-by`, because only a person can certify it.

A model may help you review, but it cannot be the thing that approves a change;
an automated review comment is not a second pair of eyes, it is the same pair.
If a human cannot read every line, use more than one model rather than none —
one looking for mistakes, one watching this ratio, and something in an advisory
seat by default. Treat what they return as a source to filter, not a checklist
to execute: keep the points that survive contact with the evidence, say plainly
which ones you dropped and why. And keep the limit in view. Independent evidence
is what turns a guess into a finding; a second model agreeing with the first is
still a guess, just a more confident one.

Finish what you started before you start again. When an approach stalls or a test
fails, find the cause in the message, line, and stack before changing approach.
Never blind-retry or rewrite working code without finding the root cause: a restart
throws away what worked, and it usually arrives back at the same wall from further
away. Half a rewrite is worse than either version.

Finish one thing before starting the next. Volume is why this became a crisis:
projects have closed bug bounties, gone zero-tolerance, started auto-closing
outside pull requests, and in at least one case shut down entirely, all over
being flooded. Do not flood anyone.

Write like a person, not like a report. Open with a short plain sentence saying
what the change is and why, then keep going in ordinary sentences: what was
wrong, what you did, and anything a reviewer would trip over. No blog structure,
no bulleted lists where a paragraph works, no headline subheadings inside a
commit message, no tables for three items. If a reader has to skim past
formatting to reach the content, the formatting lost.

Do not scatter per-tool instruction files across the repository. This file is
the contract and every assistant reads it. Anything specific to your own tool —
`CLAUDE.md`, `CURSOR.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/`, `.claude/` and the rest —
stays local and gitignored. Those files are noise to everyone not using that
tool, they drift out of sync with each other, and a repository collecting one
per vendor has already lost the thing they were meant to protect.

## Project specifics

LetFit is a quantization toolkit for large language models, shipping as a Python
library with a CLI. There is no implementation yet, so there is no build and no
test command; add them here when they exist rather than describing what they
will be.

Quantization work fails in a way this repository has to guard against
specifically: a method that loads, runs, and produces fluent output can still
have lost the accuracy it was supposed to preserve, and no test catches that. A
number for a method is a number you measured, on a named model, with a named
evaluation, at a named bit width. If you did not run it, say the method is
unevaluated. Never carry a figure over from a paper's table and present it as
this tool's result.

The reference implementations these methods come with are usually written for
one model family and one runtime. Read them before writing a second mechanism,
and expect their edge cases — grouping, outlier handling, layers deliberately
left at higher precision — to be the part that matters.

## Is this working?

You will know it is when diffs contain only what was asked for, when reviews
stop turning into rewrites, and when questions arrive before the work rather
than after the mistake.
